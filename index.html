            <p>I come from under the hill, and under the hills and over the hills my paths led. And through the air, I am
                he that walks unseen. I am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I was chosen for the lucky
                number. I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive again from the water.
                I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me. I am the friend of bears and the guest of eagles.
                I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I am Barrel-rider.*</p>

            <p>Despite not literally being Bilbo Baggins, I like to think that I share his taste for adventure. Last year
                I quit a tedious desk job and went straight to Europe (true story), venturing through a dozen major cities
                in the United Kingdom. Above you can see me at the top of the London Eye, next to my old friend Big Ben,
                at the conclusion of the voyage of a lifetime. I love to travel, and there are so many more places I wish
                to go!
            </p>
