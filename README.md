# Bootstrap-Portfolio
    This portfolio contains the HTML for a mobile-responsive website. Some Bootstrap elements have been incorporated, but some work remains to be done. Here is the pseudocoding for the rest of the project:

    1) Change the specs for the navbar so that the constituent elements display inline
    2) Make the header and footers stick to the bottom of the page. May need to use "display: static" property
    3) Create container and appropriate font for main content. Will likely need to use ".container" class
